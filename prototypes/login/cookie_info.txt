LoginLogin - username
LogonId - some integer number (user id?)
CRC - hash

Cookies are all the time the same in current login session


After removal of CRC cookie i'm unlogged


When I login again - my CRC hash and LogonId are the same again! - WTF? .... ok

When I click logout, all of these cookies are removed
